Title: Share me on G+
Tags: Google Plus, G+, social
Category: misc
Slug: gplus-sharing

It's not something of a secret that I'm a fan of Google+ and would like more people to get on there rather than stay on Facebook.

Considering this I've added a G+ +1 button on articles on this blog, so if you see something share-worthy don't hesitate to hit it with great passion!

The associated GitHub issue is:

1. [issue #10 - add Google+ share button](https://github.com/fuzzmz/fuzzmz.github.com/issues/10)

You can also easily find and circle me by using [this link](http://gplus.to/fuzzmz).
