I was a bit bored so I decided to make a short screencast in which I solved exercise 26 of [Learn Python The Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/).

It all started because of a thread on the Good Old Games forum where MrWilli [was asking about a good way to start learning programming](http://www.gog.com/en/forum/general/what_do_i_need_to_learn_my_first_computer_language/post1), so this is goes out to him and all the nice people over at [GOG\.com](http://gog.com).

It was all done in mixed environment, where the code editing and versioning was done on Windows using Sublime Text 2 and the actual Python install was under an Ubuntu VM running on top of Oracle Virtualbox, mostly because I didn't want to install Python under Windows.
