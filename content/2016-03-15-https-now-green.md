The blog is now green! Well, better said, parts of the URL bar are now green because this is being served to you by way of a magical HTTPS connection.

Despite this space being a collection of static web pages, and despite the fact that I'm not using any tracking or advertising, I still think it's a good idea to serve content over a secure connection, partly because this way the content can't be tampered with or ads injected into it by ISPs or other 3rd parties (in most cases).

Thanks to the great people at [Kloudsec](https://kloudsec.com/github-pages) who auto-provision and auto-renew LetsEncrypt certs for Github Pages with custom domains. You can find out more about them [here](https://gist.github.com/coolaj86/e07d42f5961c68fc1fc8#gistcomment-1717078).
