This is my attempt at getting the `Pelican
<http://pelican.readthedocs.org/en/2.7.2/index.html>`_ blog system installed on my new VPS.

This is also a first **Hello World** blog post, as is customary. So, hello! I'm not sure yet what this blog is going to be about, most likely about my adventures in learning more about the wonderful word of Linux server administration and geekiness.

It's also a bit weird to write this as I haven't learned much about the reStructredText format, which is used behind the scenes to write the posts.

In any case, hope you'll have fun reading this as I have writing it.
