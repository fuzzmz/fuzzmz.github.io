Feeds are now available for this website in case you want to keep up to date using a feed reader such as [Google Reader](http://reader.google.com). The general feed can be found at [http://feeds.feedburner.com/qwertyfuzz/main](http://feeds.feedburner.com/qwertyfuzz/main) in case your browser doesn't display any feed availability notifier in its interface.

Currently the per category feeds aren't properly working (see [issue #7 - fix feeds for categories](https://github.com/fuzzmz/fuzzmz.github.com/issues/7)) but I hope to get them up and running as soon as possible.

The associated GitHub issues regarding generating feeds are:

1. [issue #4 - Serve feeds through FeedBurner](https://github.com/fuzzmz/fuzzmz.github.com/issues/4)
2. [issue #5 - Change feed location for Feedburner transition](https://github.com/fuzzmz/fuzzmz.github.com/issues/5)
3. [issue #6 - Feed not enabled in html header](https://github.com/fuzzmz/fuzzmz.github.com/issues/6)
