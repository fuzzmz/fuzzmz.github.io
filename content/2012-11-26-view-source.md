You can now view the article markdown source by clicking on the **view: article source** in the article info pane, just beneath the associated tags list.

If you're curious about the changes made in the backend for this to function you can always take a look at the *[Add 'View Article Source' link](https://github.com/fuzzmz/fuzzmz.github.com/issues/1)* issue on GitHub.
